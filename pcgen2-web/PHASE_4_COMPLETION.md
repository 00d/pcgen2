## Phase 4 Implementation Complete

### 1. Multiclass Support ✅

#### Backend Implementation

**Character Model Enhancement** (`backend/src/models/Character.ts`)

**Multiclass Rules Implemented**
✅ BAB = highest progression (good/moderate/poor)
✅ Saves = best-of (fort/ref/will)

3. Integrate service worker registration
4. Test offline functionality
5. Complete E2E testing

### Short Term
1. Deploy Phase 4 to staging
2. User acceptance testing
3. Performance optimization
4. Security audit
5. Load testing

### Medium Term (Phase 5)
