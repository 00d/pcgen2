## Backend Implementation

### New Endpoints

#### 1. JSON Export Endpoint
```typescript
GET /api/characters/:id/export/json

Response Headers:
- Content-Type: application/json
- Content-Disposition: attachment

Response Body: Complete character object
```

**Implementation:**
- Retrieves character via characterService
- Sets appropriate HTTP headers for download
- Returns complete character object as JSON

#### 2. Markdown Export Endpoint
```typescript
GET /api/characters/:id/export/markdown

Response Headers:
- Content-Type: text/markdown; charset=utf-8
- Content-Disposition: attachment

Response Body: Formatted markdown document
```

**Implementation:**
- Retrieves character via characterService
- Formats character data as markdown tables
- Calculates ability modifiers dynamically
- Groups skills by ability
- Organizes spells by level
- Generates timestamp

**Code Statistics:**
- ~130 lines of markdown formatting logic
- ~110 lines of export endpoint implementations
- ~310 lines total backend code

---

## Frontend Dependencies

### New Package
- **html2pdf.js** (^0.10.1) - Client-side PDF generation

**Why this library:**
- Lightweight (no backend PDF service needed)
- Simple API (just set options and generate)
- Handles complex HTML layouts well
- Free and open-source

**Package.json Update:**
- Added to dependencies (not devDependencies)
- Can be dynamically imported only when needed
- Minimal impact on bundle size (~50KB gzipped)

---

## Integration with Character Viewer

### Export Dropdown Menu
**Location:** Character viewer header (`/characters/[id]/view`)

**Added Elements:**
- Export button with dropdown arrow
- Dropdown menu with JSON and Markdown options
- Both options trigger file downloads

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const handleExportJSON = async () => {
  window.location.href = `/api/characters/${character._id}/export/json`;
};

const handleExportMarkdown = async () => {
  window.location.href = `/api/characters/${character._id}/export/markdown`;
};
```

**Menu Styling:**
- White background
- Gray text
- Absolute positioning below Export button
- Hover effects on options
- Z-index: 20 (above other content)

---

## File Structure

### Created Files:
```
frontend/app/characters/[id]/print/page.tsx (550 lines)
```

### Modified Files:
```
frontend/package.json (added html2pdf.js)
backend/src/routes/characters.ts (added 2 export endpoints, ~240 lines)
frontend/app/characters/[id]/view/page.tsx (added export menu)
```

## Known Limitations

1. **PDF Generation:** Client-side only (good for privacy, may be slower for large documents)
2. **Print Layout:** May vary depending on browser and printer settings
3. **Markdown Formatting:** Basic markdown (no advanced formatting)
4. **Character Size:** Very large characters may result in large files

---

## Performance Considerations

### PDF Generation
- Dynamically imports html2pdf (only loaded when needed)
- Minimal bundle impact (~50KB gzipped)
- Client-side processing (no server overhead)
- May take 1-2 seconds for large characters

### Export Endpoints
- No database queries beyond character retrieval
- No caching needed (small payloads)
- Minimal server load
- Instant response

### File Sizes (Estimated)
- PDF: 50-200KB (depending on content)
- JSON: 5-20KB
- Markdown: 3-10KB

---

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- ✅ Authentication required (authMiddleware)
- ✅ User can only export their own characters
- ✅ No sensitive information leakage
- ✅ Files not stored on server (generated on-demand)

### XSS Prevention
- ✅ Character data sanitized before markdown generation
- ✅ No unsanitized HTML in markdown

### CSRF Prevention
- ✅ File downloads via GET requests (safe for links)
- ✅ No state mutations

---

## Dependencies

### Frontend
- `html2pdf.js` (^0.10.1) - PDF generation

### Backend
- No new dependencies required

---
