## Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns Used:
1. **Service Layer**: Each feature has a dedicated service class
2. **Repository Pattern**: Data services abstract equipment/spell lookups
3. **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints with authentication middleware
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript typing with strict mode
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with validation

### Technology Stack:
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, Jest, MongoDB/Mongoose
- **Pathfinder Rules**: Faithfully implemented 1st Edition mechanics
- **Testing**: Jest with 200+ comprehensive test cases

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Complete Remaining Systems
1. Character Export (PDF/JSON/HTML)
2. Character Management Features

### Priority 2: Frontend Integration
1. Create React components for spell management
2. Create React components for equipment management
3. Create character export UI

### Priority 3: Polish & Optimization
1. Performance optimization
2. Database indexing
3. Caching strategies
4. Bundle size optimization

## Notes

- All leveling rules follow Pathfinder 1st Edition specifications
- Equipment encumbrance uses STR × 10/20/30 multiplier (standard Pathfinder rules)
- AC calculations include armor check penalties and max DEX bonuses
- Spell slots support ability modifier bonuses as per Pathfinder rules
- All systems include comprehensive error handling and validation
- Tests cover edge cases, boundary conditions, and error scenarios
