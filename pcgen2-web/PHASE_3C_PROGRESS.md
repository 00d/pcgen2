# Phase 3c: Advanced Features - Implementation Progress

**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS
**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Scope:** Feat prerequisites, class skills, higher-level spells, multiclass support

---

## Overview

Phase 3c adds advanced features including prerequisite validation for feats, class skill filtering, expanded spell database (100+ spells), and preparatory work for multiclass support.

---

## Components Implemented

### 1. Backend Data Service: `gameData3cService.ts` ✅

**Features:**
- `FEAT_PREREQUISITES` - Prerequisite validation data for all feats
- `CLASS_SKILLS` - Class skill lists for each Pathfinder class
- `EXTENDED_SPELLS` - 40 implemented spells (0-2), structure for 100+ total
- `validateFeatPrerequisites()` - Validation function
- `getClassSkills()` - Retrieve skills for a class

**Feat Prerequisites System:**
```typescript
interface FeatPrerequisite {
  minBAB?: number;           // Minimum Base Attack Bonus
  minAbilityScores?: Record<string, number>;  // Minimum ability scores
  requiredFeats?: string[];  // Other feats required
  description?: string;      // Human-readable description
}
```

**Example Feats with Prerequisites:**
- **Power Attack:** BAB +1, STR 13+
- **Cleave:** BAB +1, STR 13+, Power Attack
- **Great Cleave:** BAB +4, STR 13+, Cleave, Power Attack
- **Spring Attack:** BAB +4, DEX 13+, Dodge, Mobility
- **Weapon Specialization:** BAB +4, Weapon Focus (same weapon)

**Class Skills Examples:**
- **Rogue:** 24 skills (most of any class)
- **Bard:** 21 skills
- **Ranger:** 14 skills
- **Fighter:** 9 skills
- **Sorcerer:** 5 skills

### 2. Backend Routes: `feats.ts` ✅

**New Endpoints:**

```typescript
GET /api/feats/:featId/validate
POST body: { bab, abilityScores, selectedFeats }
Response: { valid: boolean, unmetPrerequisites: string[] }
```

Validates if a character can select a feat based on:
- Current BAB
- Ability scores
- Previously selected feats

```typescript
GET /api/feats/:featId/details
Response: Complete feat object with all properties
```

Retrieves detailed feat information for display.

### 3. Frontend Component: `FeatPrerequisites.tsx` ✅

**Purpose:** Display and validate feat prerequisites

**Features:**
- Shows prerequisite requirements
- Lists unmet prerequisites in red
- Shows green checkmark when all prerequisites met
- Real-time validation as character stats change

**UI:**
```
✓ Prerequisites Met (or ⚠ Unmet Prerequisites)
Description: "Requires BAB +1 and STR 13+"

Unmet Prerequisites:
• BAB +1 (you have +0)
• STR 13+ (you have 12)
• Feat: Power Attack
```

### 4. Frontend: `SkillAllocator.tsx` Enhancement ✅

**Existing Features (Already Implemented):**
- Groups skills by ability score
- Shows class skill designation
- Displays "+3" bonus for class skills
- Armor check penalty indicator
- Real-time rank calculations

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
{isClassSkill && (
  <div className="text-xs text-blue-600 font-bold">Class Skill (+3)</div>
)}
```

**Status:** Component is feature-complete for class skill support.

components/FeatPrerequisites.tsx    → Prerequisite display
components/FeatSelector.tsx         → Feat selection (needs update)
components/SkillAllocator.tsx       → Already supports class skills ✅
components/SpellSelector.tsx        → Needs level filtering update
```

Selected Feats: []

Result: ✓ Prerequisites Met
```

### Example 2: Spring Attack
```

Selected Feats: [dodge, mobility] ✓

Result: ⚠ Unmet: BAB +4 (you have +2)
```

### Example 3: Weapon Specialization
```
Character Stats:
- BAB: +4 ✓
Selected Feats: [weapon_focus] ✓
Weapon Specialization Weapon: Longsword
Weapon Focus Weapon: Longsword ✓

## Integration Points Needed

### Backend Integration:
```typescript
// In gameDataService.ts seedPathfinderData():
import { EXTENDED_SPELLS, CLASS_SKILLS, FEAT_PREREQUISITES } from './gameData3cService';

// Update feat seeding to include prerequisites
const feats = this.getPathfinderFeats()
  .map(feat => ({
    ...feat,
    prerequisites: FEAT_PREREQUISITES[feat.id as keyof typeof FEAT_PREREQUISITES]
  }));

// Update class seeding to include skills
const classes = this.getPathfinderClasses()
  .map(pClass => ({
    ...pClass,
    classSkills: CLASS_SKILLS[pClass.id]
  }));

// Use EXTENDED_SPELLS for spell seeding
const spells = EXTENDED_SPELLS;
```

### Frontend Integration:
```typescript
// In FeatSelector.tsx
import FeatPrerequisites from './FeatPrerequisites';

// For each feat:
{feat.prerequisites && (
  <FeatPrerequisites
    featId={feat.id}
    characterBAB={characterBAB}
    abilityScores={abilityScores}
    selectedFeats={selectedFeats}
    prerequisites={feat.prerequisites}
  />
)}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries:
- Spell queries by level (cache with 24hr TTL)
- Feat prerequisite checks (client-side validation preferred)
- Class skill lookups (static, cache indefinitely)

### Frontend Performance:
- Prerequisite validation: O(n) where n = number of prerequisites
- Class skill filtering: O(m) where m = number of skills
- Spell filtering: O(p) where p = total spells

**Optimization:** Use useMemo for expensive calculations

---

## Multiclass Support (Phase 3c/4 Preparation)

### Current State:
- Character schema supports multiple classes in array
- Level is tracked per class
- Skills per level accounts for first class only

### Multiclass Requirements:
1. Multiclass penalty tracking
2. Stacking feat requirements
3. Spell progression by class
4. Hit dice combination
5. Prestige class support

**Status:** Deferred to Phase 4 (out of scope for Phase 3c)

---

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete Spell Database:** Add 60+ more spells for levels 3-9
2. **Integrate Backend:** Update gameDataService to use Phase 3c data
3. **Frontend Integration:** Add prerequisites to FeatSelector
4. **Testing:** Execute E2E tests for all Phase 3c features
5. **Commit:** Final Phase 3c commit with all features

---

## Estimated Completion Time

**Phase 3c Remaining Work:**
- Spell database completion: 2-3 hours
- Backend integration: 1 hour
- Frontend integration: 2 hours
- Testing: 1 hour
- **Total Estimated: 6-7 hours**

**Current Session Time Used:** ~2 hours
**Estimated Remaining:** 4-5 hours to Phase 3c completion

---

## Conclusion

Phase 3c is well underway with strong foundational components in place. The architecture is clean and extensible. Main remaining work is:

1. Complete spell database expansion
2. Integration of Phase 3c data into seeding
3. Frontend component integration
4. Comprehensive testing

All core functionality is designed and ready for implementation. Next session can focus on completing the spell database and integration testing.

**Status:** ✅ ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE, 🚧 IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS
**Next Action:** Complete spell database and integrate with backend seeding
