# Phase 2: Full Character Builder - Frontend Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

**Phase 2 frontend implementation is 100% complete.** All components, pages, Redux slices, and type definitions for the full Pathfinder 1st Edition character builder have been created and integrated.

## What's Been Completed

### Type Definitions Extended ✅

**gameRules.ts**:
- `Feat` interface with type, prerequisites, benefit

## What's Ready for Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start backend: `npm run dev` in `backend/`
2. Seed data: `curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/game-rules/seed`
3. Start frontend: `npm run dev` in `frontend/`
4. Navigate to character creation (Step 1-2 from Phase 1)
5. Test new Phase 2 steps (3-6)

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Point buy validation (scores 8-15, costs 0-7)
- [ ] Racial modifier application (e.g., Human +2 STR shows correctly)
- [ ] Feat selection and deselection
- [ ] Skill point allocation and calculation
- [ ] Equipment weight and encumbrance levels
- [ ] Spell selection for spellcasters only
- [ ] Character summary review
- [ ] Save character to database
- [ ] Navigation between all steps
- [ ] Back button functionality

### Known Limitations

1. **Prerequisite Validation**: Feat prerequisites are displayed but not validated against character stats (future enhancement)
2. **Class Skills**: Skill allocation doesn't yet filter by class (shows all skills, TODO: tie to class definition)
3. **Spell Slots**: Only supports 1st level spells (cantrips + 1 level); higher levels need class level support
4. **Equipment**: Limited to 5 items in database (Phase 2 scope limitation, easily expandable)
5. **Multiclass**: Single class only (multiclass in Phase 3)

## Integration with Phase 1

- ✅ Builds on existing race and class selection
- ✅ Uses current character model
- ✅ Maintains Redux state flow
- ✅ Follows established routing patterns
- ✅ Matches UI styling (TailwindCSS)
- ✅ Uses existing API infrastructure

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. **Backend Enhancement**
   - Prerequisite validation endpoint
   - Class skill filtering endpoint
   - More game content (feats, spells, equipment)

2. **Frontend Polish**
   - Feat prerequisite validation
   - Enhanced error messages
   - Mobile responsiveness optimization
   - Character printing/PDF export

3. **Additional Features**
   - Character editing after creation
   - Character deletion
   - Multiclass support
   - Custom feat/class creation
