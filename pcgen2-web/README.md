# PCGen2 - Modern MERN Stack Character Generator

A modern web-based recreation of PCGen (character generator for tabletop RPGs) using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with Next.js.

## Status: âœ… Phase 5 Complete

**All 5 development phases completed** with 674+ tests passing and 14,300+ lines of production code.

**ðŸ“– For Complete Project Documentation, See**: [DOCUMENTATION.md](./DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Overview

This project migrates the desktop-based PCGen application to a modern web platform with complete support for Pathfinder 1st Edition character creation, advancement, equipment management, and spell systems.
