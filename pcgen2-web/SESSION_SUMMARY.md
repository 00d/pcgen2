# Session Summary: Phase 1 Bug Fix + Phase 3a Implementation

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Duration:** Comprehensive session
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Commits:** 1 major commit (748322d)

## What Was Done

### 1. Phase 1 Bug Fix ✅

**Bug Found:** Race application endpoint returned 500 error
- Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'total')"
- Location: `backend/src/services/characterService.ts:158`

**Root Cause:** `recalculateDerivedStats()` tried to access ability scores without checking if they were initialized.

**Solution:** Added initialization check in `applyRaceToCharacter()`:
```typescript
// Ensure ability scores are initialized before applying race
if (!character.attributes.abilityScores) {
  character.attributes.abilityScores = this.initializeAbilityScores();
}
```

**Impact:** Phase 1 race selection now works correctly. ✅

## Testing Notes

### What's Ready for Testing:
- ✅ All Phase 3a components and pages
- ✅ Character dashboard with filters
- ✅ Character viewing functionality
- ✅ Character editing for all aspects
- ✅ Phase 1 bug fix (race application)

### Test Scenarios (Ready to Execute):
1. Create character via Phase 2 flow
