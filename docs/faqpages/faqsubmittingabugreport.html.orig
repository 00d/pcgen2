<h1 id="the-jira-issue-tracker">The JIRA issue tracker</h1>
<p>The PCGen project uses a system named <code>JIRA</code>, located at <a href="http://jira.pcgen.org">jira.pcgen.org</a>, to track bug reports and feature requests (<em>issues</em>).</p>
<p>This page explains how to submit bug reports or feature requests for the PCGen project.</p>
<p>Note: JIRA has replaced the previous issue tracker at SourceForge, which is no longer used.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-an-issue">Submitting an issue</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Search JIRA to see if your issue has already been discussed.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Searching in JIRA.</p>
</div>
<p>You can enter search terms (i.e. <em>bardic music</em>) in the search box at the top right-hand side of the screen. A list of issues matching your search terms will be shown. Check this list to see if your issue has already been discussed.</p>
<p>If your issue has already been discussed, you should consider adding a comment to the existing issue, instead of filing a duplicate issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Sign up for JIRA and log in. (See: <a href="#account-creation-and-log-in">Account creation and log-in</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <em>Create Issue</em> button at the top of the screen.</p>

<li>In the <em>Project</em> field, select the part of PCGen that needs to be fixed or enhanced. (See: <a href="#sub-projects">Sub-projects</a>.)</li>
<li>Select the <em>Issue Type</em> - either <em>Bug</em> or <em>Feature Request</em>.
<ul>
<li>A <strong>bug</strong> is a thing which PCGen <em>should already do</em>, but PCGen contains the wrong data, does the wrong thing, or malfunctions.</li>
<li>A <strong>feature request</strong> is a thing PCGen <em>doesn't do yet</em>, which you would like it to do; or, a piece of data which is missing, which should be added.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <em>Summary</em> is the title of the issue. It should be a short sentence describing what your issue is about.</li>
<li>Select a <em>Priority</em>:
<ul>
<li><strong>Blocker</strong> (most severe) - The entire program is un-usable.</li>
<li><strong>Critical</strong> - some major feature, which most people use, is broken and does not work.</li>
<li><strong>Major</strong> - some major feature, which most people use, needs improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Minor</strong> - some minor feature, which some people use, needs improvement.</li>
<li><strong>Trivial</strong> (least severe) - Some minor feature needs to be tweaked.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your <em>Environment</em> is the version of PCGen you are using, the Java version you are using, and your operating system. Example: <em>PCGen 6.05.03, Java 1.8, Windows 7.</em> (See: <a href="#determining-your-pcgen-and-java-versions">Determining your PCGen and Java versions</a>.)</li>
<li><p>The <em>Description</em> should include as much detail as required to fully explain your issue.</p>
If you are experiencing a bug, then describe:
<ul>
<li>What you were trying to do</li>
<li>What you <em>expected</em> to happen</li>
<li>What went wrong, i.e. how the program failed to do what you expected. Include details of any error messages that appear.</li>
<li>Instructions for re-producing the error. Ex: <em>Open PCGen, click New Character, go to Skills tab, add a rank in the Climb skill...</em></li>
<li>Any troubleshooting steps you have already tried: i.e. <em>I uninstalled PCGen, then re-installed the latest version of PCGen...</em> An example description of a bug is shown in the screenshot.</li>

<h1>Submitting a Bug Report for PCGen</h1>
<p>The purpose of this document is twofold:</p>
<ol class="indent1">
<li>To provide a walk through of how to properly submit a bug
report at the PCGen issue tracker (JIRA)</li>
<li>To explain what *IS* a <strong>Bug</strong> and what is a
<strong>Feature Request</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Defining a Bug vs. a Feature Request</h2>
<p>A bug is an error in the program or list files that prevents
actual execution of the program or the feature you are attempting
to use. The distinction can be a little tricky, as sometimes a
class may not function correctly because all the features that make
up that class may not have been implemented into the list files or
the code just yet. If a portion of the program worked before, but
is now no longer working, there are a number of steps you can
follow to decide whether it is a bug or a missing feature.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the correct versions of Java (1.5.x is
recommended) and PCGen installed (<a href=
"http://pcgen.org/">http://pcgen.org/</a>
for the latest version)</li>
<li>Make sure you have the desired Source Materials Loaded</li>
<li>If you are not sure or can not load the Source Material, please
see Part 1 of this FAQ.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the Source Materials are loaded, can you duplicate the
problem every time? If you can duplicate it every time, does an
"Error Window" appear? (Please note what the error says as it will
help in diagnosing/fixing your problem). If there is no "Error
Window", make note of the exact steps you used to duplicate the
problem.</p>
<p>If something is missing from the list files, whether it be a
class, a feat, or a piece of equipment, THIS IS NOT A BUG. A
Feature Request (FREQ) is what is needed (See <a href=
"faqsubmittingabugreport.html">Submitting a Feature Request</a>) to
get the missing information entered into the list files.</p>
<p>Check to make sure that this is not something that may be
missing from a list file, If you are unsure how to do this, you can
ask for help at the PCGen Yahoo Group message boards (<a href=
"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pcgen</a>),
there are any number of people who can tell you what the status of
a certain list file may be.</p>
<p>Once you have determined that this is NOT a missing feature from
a list file or coding standpoint, the next step is to delete and
re-install PCGen.&nbsp; If you have custom Source Material set up,
please remember to backup this material in a safe directory.</p>
<p>Once you re-install PCGen, try to duplicate the error. If after
a fresh install, the problem still persists, then it's time to
enter a Bug Report into Source Forge.</p>
<h2>Submitting your Bug</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to <a href=
"http://jira.pcgen.org">http://jira.pcgen.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search through the listed bugs to see if your problem has
already submitted. If it is, add a message at the bottom of the bug
report detailing your information as well.&nbsp; This will let us
know that this is a recurring problem that needs some serious
attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it does not exist, see the guide at <a href=
"http://wiki.pcgen.org/PCGen_Jira_Guide">http://wiki.pcgen.org/PCGen_Jira_Guide</a>
to enter a new issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assuming this bug was first discussed on one of the Yahoo!
mailing lists, then add a link to the issue back to that
discussion.</p>

<p>Once the issue is created, the project team will be notified there is a new issue for their attention.</p>
<p>You will be notified via email if the project team needs any more information, and when the issue is resolved.</p>

<h2 id="sub-projects">Sub-projects</h2>
<p>The JIRA system contains several &quot;sub-projects&quot;, representing parts of the overall PCGen project.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">The sub-projects displayed on the JIRA front page.</p>
</div>
<p>The sub-projects are as listed below.</p>
<p>Filing your issue under the right sub-project helps members of the development team to keep track of their part of the project. If in doubt, pick the sub-project you think is the closest match for your issue; someone will fix it up afterwards, if required.</p>
